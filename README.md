## Elizabeth Thompson ‚Äî Data Scientist



üë©üèº‚Äçüíª **About Me:**

I am a data scientist with more than three years of experience in data analysis and data science. I am currently studying for my MS in Foundations of Data Science at NC State.

At Yum! Brands, I also improved the company‚Äôs forecasting models by applying innovative approaches to working with models with little or no data. I also worked on exciting new AI initiatives, building multi-agent workforces using Large Language Models and performing prompt engineering. 

As a researcher at UNC Chapel Hill, I pioneered industry research on burnout and working conditions that was cited at national conferences and appeared in media, such as NPR and the Poynter Institute. In my research, I regularly performed regression analysis, text analysis and data mining ‚Äî among other data science techniques.
 
I am always growing my data science toolbox, whether it be time series analysis or machine learning techniques, such as deep learning or decision trees. I also consult on a variety of data science projects, ranging from data visualization to data analysis to AI engineering.

üìö **Educational Background:**

Specialized coursework in Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Applied Statistical Methods, Linear Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms, Social Computing and Decentralized Artificial Intelligence, Uncertainty Quantification for Physical and Biological Methods, Data-Driven Problem Solving in Practice.

üõ† **Technical Toolbox:**
Python (3+ years), R (4+ years), SQL (4+ years), Snowflake, Git, LATEX.


üìä **Featured Projects:**

[Trustworthy AI for Epidemiology Applications](https://github.com/ecthompsoncodes/FDS-Epi-Project): Machine learning project in collaboration with Sandia National Labs aimed at predicting COVID-19 hotspots during the early stages of the pandemic. Read the [report](https://github.com/ecthompsoncodes/ecthompsoncodes/files/15179460/Trustworthy_AI_for_Epidemiology_Applications.1.pdf).

[Multi-Agent Schelling Segregation Analysis](https://github.com/ecthompsoncodes/Multi-Agent-Segregation-Model): This is a multi-agent model simulating the Schelling Segregation Model, which showed that even mild bias can lead to a highly segregated society.
